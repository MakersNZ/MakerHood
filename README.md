#####We are the #makerhood, a community that creates its own destiny.

An initiative designed and led by the South Auckland community, in New Zealand, to develop a generation of creative, entrepreneurial, engaged and full of purpose people.

Tapping into two already existing projects Oceania Career Academy and The Roots, #makerhood creates a platform for young South Aucklanders to leapfrog from unemployment and underpaid jobs to the most valuable skills in the world we are living in.

The secret: Fusion
Design + Trades
Thinking + Doing
Creativity + Practicality
Minds + Hands
Immediate + Futuristic
Low tech + High tech
